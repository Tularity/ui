 * specific and recurring problem: a Button that must actually be an anchor for
 * routing, or a Tooltip trigger that must not add a <span> that breaks a flex
 * layout. The alternative — an `as` prop — cannot type the resulting props
 * correctly and forces every component to re-declare polymorphic generics.
 *
 * Merge rules, in the order that surprises people:
 * - Event handlers compose: the slot's handler runs first, then the child's.
 *   If the slot's handler calls `preventDefault`, the child's still runs; that
 *   is deliberate, because the child is the more specific author.
 * - `className` concatenates rather than overwrites.
 * - `style` merges, child wins on conflict.
 * - Everything else: the child's value wins, because the child was written by
 *   the consumer and the slot props are the framework's defaults.

 * trailing chevron — cannot hand all of that to `Slot` directly, because Slot
 * needs exactly one element to merge onto and would see three. Wrapping the
 * consumer's node in `Slottable` says "this one is the target"; Slot then
 * clones it and drops the surrounding decoration inside it, in place.
 *
 * Renders nothing itself. Slot consumes it before React ever sees it.
