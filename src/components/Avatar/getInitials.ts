/**
 * Reduces a person's name to the one or two characters an avatar can show.
 *
 * The naive implementation — split on spaces, take the first letter of the
 * first and last word, uppercase both — is wrong for a large share of the
 * world's names, and the people these interfaces serve are multilingual.
 *
 * Scripts written without word separators are the loud failure. 王小明 is one
 * "word", so a Latin-style rule yields 王 twice or the whole name; the reading
 * that a Chinese, Japanese or Korean speaker expects is the single leading
 * character, which is the surname. So an ideographic or syllabic leading
 * character short-circuits to exactly one character.
 *
 * The rest of the rules exist for cases that turn up constantly in real data:
 * a single-word name gives one initial rather than two copies of the same
 * letter; a middle name is skipped in favour of the family name at the end;
 * punctuation-only tokens are ignored so "Maria (interpreter)" does not become
 * "M("; and every character is taken through `Array.from` so an astral
 * codepoint is not sliced in half into two replacement glyphs.
