 * Ephemeral, non-modal feedback.
 *
 * LIVE REGION MECHANICS
 * ---------------------
 * The viewport is rendered unconditionally, empty, for the entire life of the
 * provider. This is the single most commonly broken thing about toasts: a live
 * region only announces content inserted into a region the platform was already
 * observing, so mounting the region and the first toast in the same commit
 * announces nothing at all. Rendering the container up front is what makes the
 * first toast of a session behave like the tenth.
 *
 * For the same reason the viewport is not portalled. `Portal` defers its mount
 * by one render so it is safe to render on a server, and that one-render gap is
 * long enough for a child's mount effect to push a toast into a region that does
 * not exist yet. `ToastProvider` belongs at the app root, where a `position:
 * fixed` element has nothing above it to establish a containing block.
 *
 * `aria-atomic="false"` is not decoration. `role="status"` carries an implicit
 * `aria-atomic="true"`, which would make every change re-announce every toast
 * currently on screen — so the fourth toast in a burst would be read as all four
 * from the top. Overriding it back to false means only the added node is spoken.
 *
 * Danger toasts carry `role="alert"` on the toast itself, nested inside the
 * polite region. An element with its own `role` establishes its own politeness
 * for its subtree, so a failure interrupts while an "Exported" confirmation
 * waits its turn — which is the whole reason for the distinction. The region
 * around it stays polite so it can keep its identity across the session.
 *
 * DISMISSAL IS TWO STEPS
 * ----------------------
 * Dismissing flips the record to `open: false` rather than removing it, so the
 * node stays in the tree long enough to slide back out the way it came; the
 * item drops the record once `usePresence` reports the exit finished. That
 * costs one rule for the live region: a closing toast is never updated, because
 * a text change inside a region the platform is still observing would announce
 * a notification the user has just dismissed.
 *
 * TIMING
 * ------
 * Auto-dismiss pauses on hover and on focus-within. Focus matters more than
 * hover: a keyboard user tabs into the toast to reach its action, and without
 * the pause the toast they are reading is removed from under their focus after
 * five seconds, which drops focus to the top of the document. WCAG 2.2.1 also
 * wants a way to extend a time limit; `duration: 0` is that escape hatch for
 * anything the user genuinely must act on.
