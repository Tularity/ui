 * A status pill: "Live", "Ended", "Needs review".
 *
 * THE TEXT IS THE SIGNAL
 * ----------------------
 * Every variant here is a colour, and colour is never allowed to be the only
 * carrier of meaning (WCAG 1.4.1). So the badge has no icon-only or dot-only
 * mode: its children are required and they are what says what the state is.
 * The dot exists to make a row of badges scannable at a glance for people who
 * do see the hue, which is why it is `aria-hidden` and why removing it costs
 * nothing but speed.
 *
 * The badge is a `<span>` with no role. A status pill that changes as a session
 * progresses should not announce itself from inside the badge — the live region
 * belongs around whatever owns the state, not around one of possibly twenty
 * pills in a table, each of which would otherwise shout on every poll.
