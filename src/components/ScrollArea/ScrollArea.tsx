/**
 * A bounded scrolling region that tells its consumer where its edges are.
 *
 * `data-scrolled-top` and `data-scrolled-bottom` land on the root, and each one
 * means "there is content hidden past this edge" — the signal a fade or a shadow
 * needs, and the signal that is wrong if you compute it from `scrollTop` alone
 * without accounting for the container's own height.
 *
 * WHY THE ATTRIBUTES ARE WRITTEN BY HAND
 * --------------------------------------
 * They are set with `toggleAttribute` on the DOM node rather than rendered from
 * state, and this is the central decision in the file. A live transcript pane is
 * the worst case this component exists for: it scrolls continuously while new
 * lines arrive, and routing an edge flag through `setState` re-renders the pane
 * and every message in it on the way to changing one attribute that only CSS
 * ever reads. Writing the attribute directly costs a style invalidation on the
 * root and nothing else. React never renders these attributes, so it has no
 * opinion about them and will not clobber them. Consumers who need the value in
 * JavaScript get `onEdgesChange`, which fires on a transition rather than on a
 * scroll.
 *
 * The scroll listener is passive — a non-passive listener on a scroller blocks
 * the compositor until the handler returns, which is how a scroll starts to feel
 * heavy — and every read is coalesced into one `requestAnimationFrame`, so a
 * flick that fires forty scroll events measures once per frame instead.
 * `ResizeObserver` watches both the viewport and the content, because those
 * change independently: the viewport when the surrounding layout moves, the
 * content when a line of transcript arrives. Without the second one the bottom
 * edge flag goes stale the moment the pane grows.
 *
 * KEYBOARD
 * --------
 * `focusable` defaults to true. A region that scrolls but cannot be focused is a
 * WCAG 2.1.1 failure whenever its content is not itself focusable, which is
 * exactly the transcript case; Chrome and Firefox now focus such scrollers
 * automatically but Safari does not, so the framework does not rely on it. A tab
 * stop with no name is its own problem, so a scroller that is focusable and
 * unnamed reports an error in development. Pass `focusable={false}` for a
 * scroller whose content is entirely made of focusable controls — there the tab
 * stop is redundant and the arrow keys already work.
