 * A user-facing chip: a selected language, a filter, a participant.

 * the system decided; a Tag represents something the user put there and can
 * usually take away again. That difference is the whole reason this component
 * exists separately, and it is why only this one has a remove control.
 *
 * THE REMOVE BUTTON'S NAME
 * ------------------------
 * A list of eight chips each with a button called "Remove" produces eight
 * identical entries in a screen reader's button list, and choosing between them
 * means walking the whole list to rebuild the context that was thrown away. So
 * the name always includes the tag's own text: "Remove Spanish". The text is
 * taken from `children` when it is a string and from `value` otherwise, and in
 * development a tag that offers removal without either is reported rather than
 * silently shipping the useless name.
