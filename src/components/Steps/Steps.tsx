/**
 * Linear progress through a ceremony: register a passkey, confirm it, done.
 *
 * MARKUP
 * ------
 * An `<ol>`, always, in both orientations. The horizontal arrangement is a
 * visual convenience; underneath it is a numbered sequence, and a screen reader
 * that hears "list, 3 items, item 1 of 3" gets the position and the total for
 * free — information the horizontal layout conveys only through pixels. It also
 * means the component linearises correctly when the styles fail to load or the
 * user is reading it in a text browser.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY NOTES
 * -------------------
 * - `aria-current="step"` marks the one step in progress. `step` rather than
 *   `true` because the token names what kind of "current" this is, which is how
 *   assistive technology distinguishes it from the current page in a nav.
 *
 * - Nothing here is focusable. This is a status display, not a navigation
 *   control; a user cannot skip to step three by clicking it, so making the
 *   steps tabbable would put stops in the tab order that do nothing. A wizard
 *   that genuinely allows jumping backwards should render its own buttons.
 *
 * - Colour never distinguishes one status from another on its own. A completed
 *   step draws a check, an errored step draws a warning glyph, and pending
 *   steps show their number — so the three read apart in greyscale, under a
 *   colour-vision deficiency, and in forced-colors mode where the fills are
 *   thrown away entirely. Each step also carries a visually hidden status word,
 *   because a check mark is a picture and pictures are not announced.
 *
 * - The list needs a name. There is nothing in the markup to derive one from
 *   and an unnamed list of three items is meaningless out of context, so a
 *   missing `aria-label` is reported in development.
