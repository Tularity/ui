/**
 * A short description attached to a control, shown on hover and on focus.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COMPONENT IS ACTUALLY FOR
 * -----------------------------------
 * It supplements a name; it never replaces one. That is why it wires
 * `aria-describedby` rather than `aria-label`: a labelled icon button should
 * still announce "Copy transcript, button" without a tooltip anywhere in the
 * picture, and the tip adds detail on top. Reaching for a tooltip to name a
 * control means the control has no name at all for anyone who never hovers —
 * every touch user, and every screen reader user on a control that only reveals
 * its purpose to a mouse.
 *
 * WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.13 IS THE SPEC HERE, AND IT HAS THREE PARTS
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * Dismissible: Escape closes the tip without moving focus, so a tip that
 * happens to be covering the thing the user was reading can be got rid of
 * without losing their place in the tab order.
 *
 * Hoverable: the tip itself accepts the pointer and cancels the pending close,
 * and there is a grace period on the way out. A user who is zoomed in and needs
 * to move the pointer onto the tip to read it must be able to arrive without it
 * evaporating in the gap between the trigger and the tip.
 *
 * Persistent: it stays until the pointer leaves, focus leaves, or Escape — it
 * never times out on its own, because a reader who is slower than the timeout
 * simply cannot read it.
 *
 * On top of that, and separately from 1.4.13, it opens on keyboard focus, not
 * only on hover. A hover-only tooltip is information that exists exclusively
 * for people using a mouse.
 *
 * NO INTERACTIVE CONTENT
 * ----------------------
 * A tooltip cannot contain a link, a button or anything focusable. It is not in
 * the tab order, it disappears when the pointer leaves, and `aria-describedby`
 * flattens its subtree to a string when it is announced — so a control inside it
 * is unreachable by keyboard and invisible to a screen reader, whatever it
 * looks like. Anything with a control in it is a Popover. Development builds
 * check the rendered tip and say so.
