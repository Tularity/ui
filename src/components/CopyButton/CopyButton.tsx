 * Writes `text` to the system clipboard, or throws.
 *
 * Exported on its own because the hard part of copying has nothing to do with
 * a button: a "copy link" item in a context menu, a keyboard shortcut, and a
 * cell action in a table all need the same fallback chain, and none of them
 * should have to render a CopyButton off-screen to get it.
 *
 * `navigator.clipboard` is not merely old-browser-gated. It is `undefined` on
 * every `http://` origin, which includes the LAN address an operator uses to
 * reach a booth machine, and it rejects when the document is not focused or the
 * permission was denied. The `execCommand` path still works in several of those
 * cases, so a rejection from the async API is a reason to try the old way, not
 * a reason to give up.
 *
 * The function rejects rather than returning `false` on failure. A silent
 * no-op is the worst possible outcome here: the user believes they have the
 * text, pastes nothing, and blames the paste target.

/**
 * Copies a string and confirms that it worked.
 *
 * WHY THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS PORTALLED
 * ---------------------------------
 * The confirmation has to reach a screen reader, and a colour change does not.
 * The obvious placements for the live region are both wrong. Inside the button
 * it becomes part of name-from-content, so the button's accessible name grows a
 * trailing "Copied". Beside the button it becomes a sibling element, which
 * silently breaks `:last-child` — and that selector is exactly what ButtonGroup
 * relies on to square the right-hand corners. Portalling the region to
 * `<body>` keeps the button a leaf in its own layout and leaves the DOM around
 * it untouched. The region is mounted from the start rather than created with
 * its message, because a live region that appears at the same moment as its
 * content is frequently not announced at all.
 *
 * The button's visible label also changes, which means a focused button's
 * accessible name changes with it, and some screen readers will report that on
 * top of the live region. The duplication is accepted deliberately: name-change
 * reporting is inconsistent across the combinations we care about, and it does
 * not exist at all for the icon-only case, where the name is pinned to `label`
 * so the control never stops describing what it does.
