/**
 * A tabbed interface, wired to the WAI-ARIA tabs pattern.

 * Compound rather than a list of objects, because a panel is arbitrary content
 * and threading it through a prop turns every consumer into a render-prop
 * exercise. The parts share a context carrying the generated id base, the
 * selection, and the two behaviour switches.
 *
 * KEYBOARD
 * --------
 * A roving tabindex, so Tab moves past the whole tablist in one press and lands
 * in the panel — which is the point of the pattern and what a `tabindex="0"` on
 * every tab destroys. Arrow keys follow the declared orientation and are
 * mirrored under RTL for the horizontal case. Home and End jump to the ends.
 * Space and Enter are deliberately not handled: each tab is a real `<button>`,
 * so both keys already produce a click, and adding key handling would only
 * create a second path that can disagree with the first.
 *
 * SELECTION WHEN NOTHING IS SELECTED
 * ----------------------------------
 * A tablist with no selected tab is not a valid state, so TabList adopts the
 * first enabled tab before the first paint. It reads DOM order rather than a
 * registration list, because DOM order is the order the user sees and a
 * registration list drifts from it the moment a tab is rendered conditionally.
 * The fallback is held apart from the controllable state and does NOT fire
 * `onChange`: nobody chose it, and reporting it as a change makes an
 * uncontrolled Tabs look like it was clicked on mount.
 *
 * THE SLIDING INDICATOR
 * ---------------------
 * The active marker is one pseudo-element on the tab list, positioned from
 * four custom properties that TabList writes from the active tab's offset box
 * in a layout effect. One element moving between tabs is what lets the eye
 * follow a selection from the old tab to the new one; a marker drawn on each
 * tab can only appear and disappear. Measuring is what makes the earlier
 * border-based version's objection go away: the active tab is observed for
 * size, not just the list, so a label that reflows after a webfont loads moves
 * the bar with it.
 *
 * The list wraps rather than scrolls, so the marker is placed on both axes and
 * sits under whichever row the active tab landed on. Its transitions are gated
 * behind a two-step attribute — `measured` with the first geometry, `ready` a
 * frame later — because a transition that exists on the first paint animates
 * the bar in from the list's corner.
