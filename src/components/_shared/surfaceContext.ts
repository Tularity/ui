/**
 * The labelling contract shared by Dialog and Drawer.
 *
 * Both are `role="dialog"` surfaces that must be named by their own heading,
 * and the wiring is identical: the surface owns two generated ids, the title
 * and description sub-components claim them, and the surface points
 * `aria-labelledby` / `aria-describedby` at whichever of the two actually
 * rendered. It lives here because the alternative — guessing — is worse in both
 * directions: always emitting `aria-labelledby` leaves a dangling IDREF and an
 * unnamed dialog when the consumer used `aria-label` instead, and never
 * emitting it makes the common case require manual ids at every call site.
 *
 * Registration is state rather than a DOM query so the attribute is present in
 * the same commit the heading is, not one paint later. It costs one extra
 * render when a dialog opens, which is the correct trade for a surface that
 * only mounts on an explicit user action.
