/**
 * Label, hint, error and id wiring for exactly one form control.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Baking the label into the control looks convenient until the first control
 * that has no label, or the first label that has to describe two controls. This
 * component owns the chrome and hands the control its identity through context,
 * so `Input`, `Textarea` and friends stay usable on their own and a group of
 * controls can be wrapped in `Fieldset` instead.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY NOTES
 * -------------------
 * - The error node is rendered on every pass, empty when there is nothing to
 *   say. A `role="alert"` region that is inserted at the moment it gains text
 *   is announced unreliably; one that already exists and is then filled is not.
 *   An empty block box with no padding is zero pixels tall, which is why the
 *   spacing here is margins on the children rather than a flex `gap` — a gap
 *   would reserve space around the empty node.
 *
 * - The error is wired through `aria-describedby`, never `aria-errormessage`.
 *   The latter is the semantically better attribute and is still not carried by
 *   enough of the screen-reader/browser matrix to be the only route to the text.
 *
 * - `required` sets `aria-required` on the control but deliberately not the
 *   native `required` attribute. Native constraint validation puts up the UA's
 *   own bubble, which cannot be styled or translated and competes with the
 *   error region below. A consumer who wants the browser to block submission
 *   sets `required` on the control itself, where it means what it says.
 *
 * - The asterisk is `aria-hidden`. Screen readers pronounce it as "star" or
 *   skip it entirely depending on punctuation settings, so the requirement is
 *   carried by `aria-required` and the asterisk is left as a visual convention.
