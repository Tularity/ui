/**
 * A non-modal floating panel attached to a trigger.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT NOT A DIALOG
 * --------------------------
 * Focus moves into the panel on open and returns to the trigger on close, the
 * same as Dialog. Everything else is deliberately absent: the page behind is
 * NOT marked `inert`, and the body scroll is NOT locked. That is the entire
 * distinction, and it is a semantic one rather than a stylistic shortcut — a
 * popover is a continuation of the page, so a user must be able to read the
 * paragraph it is explaining, scroll to it, and click it. A component that
 * locked scrolling would be a dialog wearing a popover's styling, and the tell
 * is the scrollbar disappearing when a small panel opens.
 *
 * Tab is still confined to the panel while it is open. Without that, tabbing
 * past the last control lands on whatever follows the trigger in the document
 * while a panel is visibly floating over it, and a keyboard user has no way to
 * tell they have left. Escape and an outside press both close it, so nothing is
 * trapped in the colloquial sense.
 *
 * POSITION
 * --------
 * `useAnchoredPosition` re-measures on scroll and resize behind a
 * requestAnimationFrame, and closes the panel outright once the trigger has
 * scrolled out of the viewport. A panel that stays pinned to the top edge after
 * its anchor has gone reads as a piece of detached chrome, and there is no
 * longer anything on screen it could be explaining.
