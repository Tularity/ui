/**
 * A level, not a task.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT PROGRESS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT COSMETIC
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * A progressbar describes an operation moving toward completion; it is expected
 * to change, it is expected to end, and a screen reader treats it as a busy
 * indicator — some announce it periodically while it runs, and some suppress
 * other output while an element in the same region is busy. A meter describes a
 * static measurement of something that is simply true right now: disk quota,
 * transcription confidence, input level. Announcing that as busy tells the user
 * an operation is underway when nothing is happening at all, and a meter that
 * reaches 100% is at capacity rather than finished — often the worst outcome
 * rather than the best. Reach for Progress when the number is going somewhere
 * and for Meter when it is a reading.
 *
 * The band colour is derived by `meterLevel` from HTML's own `<meter>` rules,
 * so `optimum` decides which end is good. Colour is not the only signal: the
 * fill length carries the value and `valueText` carries the reading, so a user
 * who cannot separate the amber band from the red one still gets the number.
 *
 * `role="meter"` on a div rather than a native `<meter>`: the native element
 * cannot be restyled to the system's shape without a different set of
 * vendor pseudo-elements per engine, and it gives nothing back that the role
 * does not already carry.
