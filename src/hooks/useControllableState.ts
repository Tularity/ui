/**
 * Lets a component be controlled or uncontrolled through one API.
 *
 * The setter is referentially stable, which is what makes it safe in a
 * dependency array and in a callback handed to a child. That stability comes
 * from `useEventCallback` — which parks the latest closure in an insertion
 * effect — rather than from writing a ref during render. The distinction
 * matters under concurrent rendering: a render that React throws away still
 * runs its body, so a ref written there can be left holding a value from an
 * attempt the user never saw.
 *
 * The subtlety worth stating: a component must not switch modes mid-life. If
 * `value` starts defined and later becomes `undefined`, React silently falls
 * back to stale internal state and the component appears to freeze. That is a
 * consumer bug, and it is reported loudly in development rather than papered
 * over — a silent freeze is far harder to diagnose than a console error.
